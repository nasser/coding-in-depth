# Coding In Depth
## The Game

This module is designed around an Asteroids clone. The player controls a ship with the keyboard keys, rotating with left and right, moving forward and backward with up and down, firing bullets with the space bar, and must destroy a field of asteroids in order to win. Each asteroid spawns three smaller asteroids when destroyed, and the smaller asteroids do not spawn anything. If the user touches an asteroid, they lose. The class will write the code to add an enemy to the game with basic AI that will follow the player and fire bullets at them.

It is designed to be hit all of the major corners of Unity while remaining hackable. The components are well commented and designed to be interchanged. The package also comes with a lot of free art from kenney.nl that students can use while customizing the game.

Importantly, the scripts that the class will write together to implement the enemy should not be on the students’ computers to begin with as this would defeat the purpose.
